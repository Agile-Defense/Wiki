## Get started

There are two main ways to provision a new server:

### Net Boot from PXE

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This is the recommended method. It will install Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri." />}}

This will guide you step-by-step through [Net Booting. â†’]({{< relref "net-booting" >}})

### Boot from ISO file

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This method will NOT configure your server with LDAP/AD authentication." />}}

This will guide you through provisioning via [File ISO. â†’]({{< relref "file-iso" >}})
